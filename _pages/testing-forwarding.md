2. **Turn off Wi-Fi Calling:**  
   - Go to **Settings > Apps > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling**, then disable it.

3. **Turn off HD Voice:**  
   - Navigate to **Settings > Cellular > Enable LTE**, then select **Off** or **Data Only**.

Once these settings are turned off, you can proceed with testing your call forwarding configuration.

## How to Test Your Call Forwarding

1. **Tap the "Begin Test Call" Button**  
   - Open the app and navigate to the call forwarding test section.  
   - Tap the **"Begin Test Call"** button to initiate a test call to your phone.

2. **Decline the Incoming Test Call**  
   - When you receive the test call, **decline** it by pressing the **decline button** on your phone screen.

## What to Do If the Test Fails

If the call is not forwarded correctly, follow these troubleshooting steps:

- **Check the call forwarding codes:**  
  Ensure you have entered the correct forwarding numbers based on your country:

  | Country | Forwarding Number  |
  |---------|-------------------|
  | USA     | +1 415 687 5513    |
  | UK      | +44 7480 487697    |
  | France  | +33 7 5759 3937    |
  | Canada  | +1 438 802 1842    |

- **Verify your settings:**  
  Make sure that Live Voicemail, Wi-Fi Calling, and HD Voice are **turned off**, as they can interfere with call forwarding.

- **Re-enter the forwarding codes:**  
  Dial the forwarding codes again to ensure they were set up correctly.

- **Restart your phone:**  
  Some changes may take effect only after restarting your device.

- **Contact your carrier:**  
  If the call forwarding still does not work, your carrier might have additional requirements.
