# Turn Off Live Voicemail for Call Forwarding

## Overview

This guide explains why it is necessary to **turn off Live Voicemail** on your iPhone to enable seamless **call forwarding** to your virtual assistant or secretary. Live Voicemail can interfere with forwarding by intercepting calls before they are redirected, preventing them from reaching the intended destination.

## Why You Need to Turn Off Live Voicemail

Live Voicemail is an iOS feature that allows users to see a real-time transcription of incoming voicemail messages while the caller is still speaking. However, when Live Voicemail is enabled, it may:

- **Intercept forwarded calls**, preventing them from reaching your assistant or secretary.
- **Delay call forwarding**, causing potential confusion or missed opportunities.
- **Override forwarding settings**, leading to calls going to voicemail instead of being redirected.

Disabling Live Voicemail ensures that call forwarding works correctly without interference, allowing your assistant to answer your calls as intended.
