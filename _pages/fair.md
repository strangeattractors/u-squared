# Fair Use Policy for Call Plans

To ensure reliable and high-quality service for all users, our call-based plans are subject to a **fair use policy**.

## ðŸ“ž Monthly Call Limits

Each plan provides a number of monthly calls, based on normal usage patterns. Under fair use, the **average call duration should not exceed 4 minutes per call**.

| Plan    | Monthly Calls | Fair Use Cap (Minutes) |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| Free    | 40 calls       | 160 minutes            |
| Pro     | 200 calls      | 800 minutes            |
| Elite   | 1000 calls     | 4000 minutes           |

> Occasional longer calls are perfectly fine. This policy is designed to detect and prevent **consistent overuse** beyond normal patterns.

## ðŸ”’ What Happens If You Go Over?

If your usage regularly exceeds the fair use thresholds, we may:

- Temporarily restrict additional calls until the next billing cycle  
- Contact you to upgrade to a higher plan  
- Discuss custom usage options for your needs

## ðŸ’¬ Why This Policy?

This helps ensure everyone receives a stable, responsive service â€” especially during peak usage hours. Most users stay well within these limits without any issues.
