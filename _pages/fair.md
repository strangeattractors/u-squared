# Fair Use Policy for Call Plans

To ensure reliable and high-quality service for all users, our call-based plans are subject to a **fair use policy**. If your usage exceeds the fair use thresholds, you won't be able to make additional calls until the next billing cycle.

Each plan provides a number of monthly calls, based on normal usage patterns.

| Plan    | Monthly Calls | Fair Use Cap (Minutes) |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| Free    | 30 calls      | 200 minutes            |
| Pro     | 200 calls     | 1000 minutes           |
| Elite   | 1000 calls    | 5000 minutes           |
