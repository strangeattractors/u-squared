## How to activate conditional call forwarding

- Default voicemail: An enhanced voicemail that takes a message from the caller and sends a push notification with the message, a summary, transcript, audio, and assistance for next steps.

- Clone voicemail: Your clone will take over, have a conversation with the caller to capture their full intent, and you'll receive the same push notification, summary, transcript, and assistance.
