## Manually activate conditional call forwarding

If call forwarding setup failed in the app, you'll need to set it up manually outside the app.
Visit your carrier's website to find the correct codes to dial. Set up the following:

- "Conditional Call Forwarding" when unanswered
- "Conditional Call Forwarding" when busy

Depending on your country, conditionally forward your calls to one of these numbers:
- USA: +14156875513
- UK: +447480487697
- France: +33756796726
- Canada: +14388021842
