## Call forwarding

**Q: Why do I need to set up call forwarding?**

**A:** Call forwarding redirects your missed calls to us. To set it up, you'll need to dial specific numbers that vary by carrier. You can verify if call forwarding is set up correctly by going to **Profile** > **Activate Call Forwarding**.

**Q: How can I cancel call forwarding?**

**A:** Go to **Profile** > **Activate Call Forwarding** and click "Deactivate."

**Q: The call forwarding codes didn’t work. How can I set up call forwarding manually?**

**A:** Visit your carrier’s website to find the correct codes to dial. Depending on your location, use one of these numbers for call forwarding:
- USA: +14156875513
- UK: +447441447694
- Canada: +14388021842

Different types of call forwarding require different codes. Set up the following two types:
- "Conditional Call Forwarding" when unanswered
- "Conditional Call Forwarding" when busy

**Q: What if my carrier doesn’t support call forwarding?**

**A:** Unfortunately, U² requires a carrier that supports call forwarding.

**Q: Should I enable call forwarding in my iPhone settings?**

**A:** No, call forwarding in your iPhone settings should be disabled.

**Q: My carrier allows call forwarding, but it’s still not working. What should I check?**

**A:** Ensure that call forwarding is disabled in your iPhone settings and that "Live Voicemail" is also turned off.

**Q: How can I test if call forwarding is working?**

**A:** You have two options:
1. Go to **Profile** > **Activate**, click **Activate**, and follow the instructions. It may take up to one minute for changes to take effect.
2. Ask a friend to call you, but do not answer. Make sure the call goes to U² voicemail.
