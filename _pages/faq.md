## Call forwarding

### Why do I have to set up call forwarding?

You have to set up call forwarding to redirect your missed calls to us. For that you have to call special numbers that depend on your carrier. 

You can check that call forwarding was set up properly in Profile / Activate Call forwarding. 

### How do I cancel call forwarding

Go to Profile / Activate Call forwarding and click on "Deactivate"

### The call forwarding codes didn't work, how can I set up call forwarding manually?

You have to look online on your carrier's website which codes to dial and pick one of the following number to forward to, depending on where you are:
- USA: +14156875513
- UK: +447441447694
- Canada: +14388021842

There are different types of call forwarding (with different codes). You should pick those two:
- "Conditional Call forwarding" when unanswered
- "Conditional Call forwarding" when busy

### My carrier doesn't allow call forwarding, what can I do?

Unfortunately, U^2 requires a carrier that allows call forwarding.

### Should I set up call forwarding in the settings of my Iphone?

No, call forwarding in your Iphone settings should be disabled.

### My carrier allows call forwarding, I've entered the call forwarding codes but call forwarding still doesn't work

Make sure that call forwarding is disabled in your iphone settings and that "Live Voicemail" is also disabled.

### How to test if call forwarding is actually working

You have two options:
- Go to Profile > Activate, then click Activate and follow the instructions. Please allow up to one minute for the changes to take effect.
- Have a friend call you, but do not answer. Ensure that the call goes to the UÂ² voicemail
